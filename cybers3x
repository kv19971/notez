airplane vulnerability 

Lab1 
q1 obtained by DHCP by VMWARE virtual switch 
q2 range = 192.168.111.3-254
q3 Needs to be static as itll change every time it reboots. With a static fixed IP administrators know which IP address to connect to to manage the virtual machine (e.g. via VMWARE vSphere client)
q4 - Resources need to be restricted to prevent virtual machines from overprovisioning resources and hogging up the hosts resources, leaving other guests with very limited resources 
q5 - SCREENSHOT 
q6 - 	thick provision - preallocate space that is specified     
        	lazy zeroes - allocate but not done anything to space
        	eager - clear all content - set it to 0s
	thin - allocate space as needed 



ESXI - virtualization layer - linux based - hardened environment 
	can put VM instances here 
how to connect to ESXI 
	client server model - like whats being done rn 
IRL 2 physical machines - client and ESXI server 
but rn they are virtual machines 

thick provision - preallocate space that is specified 
	lazy zeroes - allocate but not done anything to space 
	eager - clear all content - set it to 0s 
		depends on your usage - 
thin - allocate space as needed
