airplane vulnerability 

Lab1 
q1 obtained by DHCP by VMWARE virtual switch 
q2 range = 192.168.111.3-254
q3 Needs to be static as itll change every time it reboots. With a static fixed IP administrators know which IP address to connect to to manage the virtual machine (e.g. via VMWARE vSphere client)
q4 - Resources need to be restricted to prevent virtual machines from overprovisioning resources and hogging up the hosts resources, leaving other guests with very limited resources 
q5 - SCREENSHOT 
q6 - 	thick provision - preallocate space that is specified     
        	lazy zeroes - allocate but not done anything to space
        	eager - clear all content - set it to 0s
	thin - allocate space as needed 



ESXI - virtualization layer - linux based - hardened environment 
	can put VM instances here 
how to connect to ESXI 
	client server model - like whats being done rn 
IRL 2 physical machines - client and ESXI server 
but rn they are virtual machines 

thick provision - preallocate space that is specified 
	lazy zeroes - allocate but not done anything to space 
	eager - clear all content - set it to 0s 
		depends on your usage - 
thin - allocate space as needed


types of security attacks 

networks mentioned 
universities moving to deny all traffics except policy 
lab computers have direct connection with rest of the network = fixed ip 
web attack - vulnerable if not using firewalls, using default passwords 
network scanning - uni has honeypots set up - these show that people are scanning the network constantly 
malware attack 

email phishing attacks and identity theft - common 
DNS attack - come back to this later 

internal attack - majority of defense mechanisms stop at firewall - so u can access internal machine to compromise the network 
	e.g. remote access lab machine, install scanning tools inside
	lateral move attack 
botnet 

ransomware and hijacking 

backdoor implanting - 

spoofing - you know  
dictionary - list of frequently used passwords
man in the middle - prevalent in WIFI - hacker can set up pineapple, change DNS mapping in wifi network - 
spamming 

sniffing - 

crackers -  break into computer software

different security layers discussed 

ENISA risk analysis 
components of risk
	impact 
	likelihood 
theory discussed 

risk management architecture segregation of duties discussed 
	used in IT audits 
	RACI discussed 
conflicts in different roles
	cant do network monitoring and network administrator - admin and monitoring person can change logs to make it look like nothing is wrong, even if there is an attack going on, for example 

latesthackingnews.com 

ASSIGNMENT 

q1 - whoami - Print  the  user name associated with the current effective user ID. 
id - Print  user and group information for the specified USER, or (when USER omit‐
       ted) for the current user.
q2 /root/ and /root/Desktop 
q3 10 
(btw for folder, execute means go inside the folder, list its contents etc)
q4 - 192.168.111.130 and 00:0c:29:49:7b:13
q5 - TCP and UDP differences pls 
q6 (actually q5) - google.fr 
q7 - -X 
q8 - (describe 3 way handshake) - ACK flags 
q9 - HUB and SWITCH - layer 2 
	router - layer 3 

LAN and WAN discussed - 
if switch working but outer network connection not there, lab machines can still communicate with each other 
	DHCP wont work as connection to router not present 
	can still communicate - as in LAN IP address not necessary 
		communication goes through mac address 
		ARP protocol used - resolves IP address to MAC address
			stored in switch - so switch knows local IP to MAC address 

q10 - capture filters are much more limited and are used to reduce the size of a raw packet capture. display filters are used to hide some packets from the packet list.

Capture filters are set before starting a packet capture and cannot be modified during the capture. Display filters on the other hand do not have this limitation and you can change them on the fly. 

Do capture filters for busy networks

in email - everything is in ASCII - attachments' content types are mentioned using mimetype - encoded in ascii - this is the presentation protocol 

can use telnet to access web pages - like in 4621 for SMTP server 

need handshake in TCP cause it offers reliability 

WIFI labs 
	wireshark - capture and select wifi interface 
	to connect to wifi - ssid and password 
		cant use wifi if you know just the password 
		SSID - can make router stop broadcasting SSID 
		can you discover hidden SSID? apparently yes
			wlan receiver - change to monitor mode 
			then do tcpdump 
			look for clear to send packets - this is the router's reply to connected clients - 
			can get SSID from router - beacon frames (if visible) - but SSID truncated in beacon frame if hidden  
			can get SSID from client
