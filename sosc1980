--missed first week --
correlation discussed 
confounding variable - variable that accounts for correlation between 2 variables 
	e.g. health cf variable for correlation between money and happiness 
can never estabilish causal relationships using correlation 

facebook usage and depression - causality possibilities 
	- people are depressed cause they lonely, use facebook 
	- people use more facebook engage in more social comparisons, get depressed 
	- millenials dont sleep, get depressed, have nothing to do so use facebook (sleep is confounding variable)
	- few real friends, more facebook to reach out, but also more depression (# of friends is confounding variable) -- this is the actual reason

ice cream example 
	- cf variable is season, people in summer get more irritated and impulsive, therefore tend to be more violent, also need ice cream when hot

survey - sample and population discussed
understand behaviour about population by generalizing behaviour of good samples 
social desirability effect - people want to appear to be socially good - can give dishonest answers for sensitive characteristics - e.g. survey about drug usage, respondents will tend to lie
	to solve, ask questions about the people around you(e.g. how many of your friends used drugs) (not applicable to all studies), make anonynomous, ensure confidentiality of survey data  
selecting representative sample is hard - e.g. finding stress levels of students at UST, and you end up selecting only students that are in the library, and student sample is not representative of all students
can also not infer a causal relationship - what is the cause of the stress? cant know from survey 

naturalistic ovservation 
	make people feel theyre in irl and make observations
	e.g. when people do nothing in public - how do people react without knowiung they are doing a survey 
	no causal relationships 
	target behaviour may not occur naturally - knowing there is a researcher looking, you wouldn't hit your child 

case study
	concerns small group of individuals - for special ones 

john joan case
	dick burned off during circumcision 
	first 2 years - child gender neutral 
		decided during parenting 
	parents raised john in feminine way 
	researchers see how john grew up, what went good and what didnt
case studies are detailed, and you keep whats needed 
can change research focus based on what you discover along the way (but in survey you have hypothesis/expectations before you start the survey)
	e.g. john developed depression, researches focused on how and why this happened instead of his gender transformation 
but you still cannot establish causal relationships - dont know what caused his depression (how u are being raised, traumatic surgery, bullying etc.)
cannot generalize to others - looking at people under special circumstances

all the above dont allow you to estabilish causal relationships (descriptive research)

experimental study - can find causal relationships 
independent variable and dependent variable 
u got 2 groups 
	experimental group - given changes (e.g. alcohol)
	control group - do not receive treatments (are sober. given placebo (it looks to alcohol but doesnt have its effects) - they will behave abnormally if they know that they are in the control group. also people have certain expectations - in case of alcohol u expect it to have impact on your behaviour. mere expectation of drinking alcohol can affect your behaviour)
core logic 
	both groups are identical in every attribute except the independent variable - otherwise you dont know what variable caused difference in behaviour 
random assignment used for assigning people to groups - eliminate all pre-existing group differences - to assume that there will be equal chance that all kinds of people are in both groups 
random sampling - selecting people at random to participate
random assignment - assigning groups at random to each person 

stanford prison experiment 
	what causes evil 
	put healthy uni students 
	assigned at random as 
		prisoners
		prison guards 
	Turned psych dept into prison 
	recruiting participants 
		candidates called and given a questionnaire to fill out 
		only taken candidates who were mentally and physically fit 
		also no candidates had a criminal record 
		24 people in total 
	for prisoners
		they were arrested on campus by actor policemen - but participants didnt know they were real 
			in order to make them believe they were arrested, they were finger-printed and placed in a holding cell, blind folded, stripped naked and searched
			they were also given ID numbers and were not allowed to use their own names - to make them adopt the identity of a prisoner 
	for prison guards 
		allowed to do anything to enforce law and order and ask for respect from the prisoners 
		given uniforms props and sunglasses (cause they didnt want prisoners to have eye contact, to induce fear and difference in status)
	guards started to humiliate the prisoners - immediately after study started
		whenever prisoners couldnt respond with id number, they were punished 
	guards did a lot to assert control
		woken up multiple times at night 
	prisoners started to rebel 
		some prisoners stopped responding to guards 
		some prisoners blocked entrance to cell, but failed 
		rebellion leaders isolated and punished 
		rebellion failed soon 
	some prisoners followed orders 
	some prisoners experienced physcological breakdown 

Independent variable in this case? 
	role of participants - prisoners or prison guards 
dependent variable 
	changes in behaviour 

readings - chapter 1 

CHAPTER 2 - EVERYDAY COPING 

Stress
Cause and response - differs greatly 

negative experience.... (definition in slides). changes psychological, cognitive, emotional and behavioural 
stressor - anything that causes stress

gender role influences repsonse 
	males dont show it - become socially withdrawn 
	females are more likely to seek help 
common stressors: 
	cataclysmic events 
		strong stressors that occur suddenly - causes large amounts of panic 
		e.g. SARS, earthquakes, terrorist attacks 
	Major life events 
		moving, finals, etc. 
		correlation between levels of stress and health problems 
		can be either positive or negative - both are stressful though 
		also need to measure subjective measures of stress 
		subjective measure stress
			user gives stress level, not asking what life event experienced 
	minor life events 
		occur frequently - e.g. traffic jams, daily hassles 
		accumulate over time (snowball effect) and cause long term sickness 
			impact of a lot of this can be same as that of a major life event 
		living independently has its own hassles 
			financial 
			pollution
			time pressure 
			work hassles - problems with colleagues etc. 
			future security hassles - jobs, gpa 
		always negative events

Missed 30 mins
-- conflict handling 

second hand stress
	stress can be contagious - you can internalize other people's stress by interacting with them -
		loose temper easily 
		irradical 
		prevalent at the workplace
			can have serious health consequences - heart attack - raised blood pressure - corinary artery disease 
			worst culprits are people who dont even know theyre stressed 
			may also overcompensate to try to diffuse - but it still shows 
		need to refocus your attention 
			something neutral - e.g. breathe, quick walk 
theories of stress - how do we react to stress?
	fight or flight 
		when stressed, go through the following chain of physiological reactions	
			heart rate increase
			respiration increases 
			make you more alert  
		this is to prepare you to fight or run away (flight)
	tend and befriend 
		gender based - females are more likely to use this 
			men by society need to be independent and 
			biological reasons - females secrete high amounts oxytocin (a stress hormone that creates your affiliative behaviour)
				- secrete estrogen - that enhances effects of oxytocin 
		general adaptation syndrome 
			alarm stage 
				become aware of stress
				physiological changes to prepare body - similar to fight or flight model 
				e.g. teacher tells you that theres a pop quiz next week - hearing that raises alarm 
				physiological changes 
					 - see slides 
					 - remember - catacholamines - raises alertness and respiration - for fight or flight 
			resistance stage 
				work at full capacity to cope with stressor - in hopes to restore to baseline 
				e.g. prepare for pop quiz to not fuck it up - spend all your time on it 
				physiological changes 
					 - cortiocosteroids - increased access to stored energy - protein and fats 
			exhaustion stage - optional
				only when stress is prolonged - or when person cannot cope with stress
				Not applicable to temporary stressor 
				e.g. if you know you'll do well on the quiz, you wont go into this stage 
				stress hormones will take a toll on your physical health - people more likely to develop physical problems 
			over time, immune system resistance stays on baseline (may have even a drop in case of denial), then goes up, then goes down in exhaustion stage 

effects of stress 
	physiological effects 
		immunosurpressive effects - immune system weakened by stress hormones 
			experiment conducted - collected blood samples well before exam and one day before - wanted to see effects of stress - measure white blood cell count (they protect against bacteria- reflect how strong immune system is) 
				well before exams - you have more wbc
				1 day before - you have significantly less wbc 
			stress vs cold 
				have the following groups 
					combined stress (combination of indicators below)
					major life event stress 
					negative affect 
					perceived stress - how stressed you think you are 
				they are given virus 
				for all these groups, the high stress group reported to have the cold more often than low stress group
				high stress group more likely to become stressed 
	physchological effects 
		psychophysiological disorders common - disorders caused by emotion, emotional and physical difficulties 
			e.g. more stressed people have skin rashes 
			physically ill people - taught how to manage stress - to reduce having this as effect 
	emotional effects 
		increased irritability and moodiness
			2nd hand stress - this is prevanlent here 
		anxiety - worry about uncertainties - 
		depression - feel sad and dumb all the time - cant experience pleasure 
		studies - changes to college life is correlated with depression 
			- students with higher levels of study pressure more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression 
			but which is cause and which is effect? is there a cofounding variable? 
	cognitive effect 
		become forgetful 
		anxious - become less focused 	
		this takes a toll on your performance - which makes you more stressed 
	
physcological moderators of stress - will be quizzed on this 
	some people are pussies - defeated even in face of small challenges 
	differences occur because of how we interpret and evaluate the stressors
	potential stressor - how it affects depends on how you appriase the stress 
	primary appraisal - meaning of stressor - positive, neutral, negative - can further have degree of harmful, threatening or challenging 
		harm - amount of damage that has already happened 
			e.g. breakup - loss of faith in people 
		threat - predict and forsee what would happen in the future 
			e.g. loose confidence after breakup 
		challenge - what you learn from the experience 
			e.g. from breakup, you learn more about yourself and life 
	secondary appraisal - what kind of coping abilities and resources you have 
		more resources you have, the less stressful youll be 
	stress response 
		greater the stress, greater the stress response 
	model accounts for why we react differently 
	personality types also affect appraisal process
		hardiness
		self-efficacy
		optimism
		two types 
			A - dont like to wait, urgency, hostility, always feeling driven - tend to be more stressed - they dont have any friends
				stress reactivity - type A people are at a larger risk of getting a coronary disease - as they produce more stress hormones 
					over time - immune system damaged, cardiovascular system damaged - basically you suck and should kill yourself ASAP 
					treat every interpersonal relationship as a competition
					they essentially create stress for themselves
					dont have support system - as they dont have friends 
					poor health habits cause "they think theyre right"
			   	positives 
					better drive 
				how to fix?
					fix sense of time urgency - belief that saving time leads to success is wrong - be realistic and slow the fuck down you retard - also avoid rush hour queues, jams etc - irrational beliefs need to be removed 
					control hostility - look for beauty in others, consider other people when they fail your expectations (dont consider them lazy or stupid right off the bat, consider situational factors, give benefit of doubt) - express appreciation and kindness of others - 
			B - patient, cooperative, not agressive, harmonious relationships 
	Hardiness - these people are more resilient against stress
		see things as challenge - if test failed they improve themselves 
		control - internal locus of control - believe that everything is in their control - can determine how things unfold 
			e.g. getting an A is a matter of efforts 
			external locus of control - outcome depends on fate, luck, lecturer
		commitment - how dedicated you are to your goal - even if obstacles arise you still try your very best 
		buffering effect 
			study - college students asked to report levels of stress - and another questionnaire to assess hardiness
				divided into groups - hardy and not hardy 
				then asked about health problems - indicate health status 
				at low levels of stress, people of both hardiness levels didnt show health complaints 
				but at higher levels of stress, people who are low on hardiness report more problems than people who are high on hardiness 
	Self-efficacy - belief that one can perform task on their own successfully 
		e.g. confidence in academic abilities - exam seen as challenge rather than as stressor 
	optimism - higher optimism can lower stress 
		optimistic people reframe stressor as a positive event
			e.g. lost money? motivated to work harder to try more money 
		therefore they appraise stress differently - as a challenge rather than sth harmful 
	also nature of stressor affects appraisal process 
		predictability - higher predictability makes stressor less effective 
		experiment - 2 groups given math test 
			group 1 - noise adminstered at random times
			group 2 - noise adminstered but warning given before noise 
			control - no noise  
			people worked best in control condition - no shit 
			worst performer - group 1
	social support - more social support affects appraisal - 
		study of common flu - healthy participants with high levels of stress
				    - asked number of close friends - size of social network
				    - given flu virus 
				    - people with more friends were less likely to develop flu 
		social support can also come from animals 
			pet owners on average tend to be less stressful
			for non pet owners, positive correlation between # of major life events and doctor visits 
			however, correlation does not hold for pet owners
			still here dont know the cause and effect 
			Allen's experimental study 
				recruited stock brokers (have stressful occupation) for study 
				they live alone - have limited social support 
				split into groups, one with pets and one without 
				exposed to public speaking - considered to be a very stressful event for most people - blood pressure changes monitored during the process
					stress hormones increase blood pressure - objective indicator of stress level 
				both groups showed blood pressure increases 
					but group with pets had less increase on average
				further confirmation - people with pets were less likely to become sick (after the public speaking thing)

Stress management 
	signficiance 
		performance correlated with stress - if your stress is within optimal range then your performance will peak 
	what is coping 
		dynamic process - depends on person and environment, which are constantly changing
			e.g. after break up, you loose faith in your partner, learn to find more friends  
		change stressor - postponement of stress
		change yourself - learned to tolerate the stress		
		types of coping 
			emotion focused - focusing on controlling emotions 
				used when stressor cannot be changed - e.g. somebody dies 
				postive reframing - so you say to yourself theyve gone to a better place 
				acceptance - people at first are in denial when experiencing stressor - but after you accept the fact, then you approach problem with a clear head   
				venting - yell at people, to make ourselves feel better 
			
	
i			problem focused 
				- change problem
			avoidant coping 
				- repress problem 
		examples 
			looking at failure as having taught you a lesson - emotion - as reframed 
			coming up with different solutions - problem focused 
			seeking help from other people - problem or emotion focused depending on help seeked 
				if help is practical e.g. asking a friend to let you copy homework - problem focused
				if help is emotion e.g. asking a friend to listen to your shit - emotion focused 

		specific coping strategies 
			 - Disclosure - express feelings about stressor (publically e.g. on FB, in discussion or privately e.g. in diary)
				study - college students selected and assigned to 2 groups - experimental (in this group, people were asked to write about stressor, coping and consequences) and control (asked to write about a trivial event e.g. recent movies seen etc)
					these participants were then followed to study impacts of disclosure over period of 6 mos 
						experimental group participants reported lower level of stress - showing that disclosure leads to lower level of stress 
				why does disclosure help? 
					- gain information and advise that helps cope better 
					- ellicit social support from others 
					- helps organize thoughts and feelings - make you clearheaded and helps you come up with a better solution
			 - Time Management - helpful for people in contemporary society 
				how to accompilish more with less time? 
					 - Estabilish priorities - deal with more important tasks first 
					 - avoid time urgency - by carefully planning and preparing in advance - dont leave things to the last minute 
					 - avoid time wasters - neither important nor soothing - identify and eliminate them 
	
				time management matrix - model to categorize tasks 
					urgent and important - cause the fires in your life 
						to move from block 1 to 2 - plan ahead - when things are less urgent then its less stressful to you
					urgent and not important - e.g. gatherings before exams - got to prioritize this stuff - do it when you have spare time - to avoid time urgency 
					block 4 - time wasters 
			 - Good health habits - eating healthy, regular exercise, dont do drugs 
				- people who exercise regularly are physiologically different than those who dont 
					those who do produce more endogenous opioids - similar effect to painkillers - reduces level of pain and protects immune system from being damaged by the stress hormones 
					opoids cannot be produced by taking supplements - only by your body 
					but most people dont exercise because theyre too stressed out - lol
			 - Relaxation - reducing the physiological arousal (production of stress hormones)
					calm yourself down by finding something soothing 
			  		e.g. deep breathing exercise - when we are under stress, we take shallow breaths - reduces amount of oxygen intake - then brain makes more stress hormones to increase respiration intake - creates a vicious cycle 
						break this cycle by breathing deep
			 - Progressive muscle relaxation exercise - work with each muscle group at a time
				for each muscle in muscles:
					tense that group of muscles and then relax 
			 - Guided imagery - therapist guides your thoughts - towards a relaxed and more focused state 	
	test anxiety
		can feel before the exam - anticipatory  
		can feel during the exam - situational 
		consequences 
			physiological effects
			psychological effects - concentration, cant be clear headed, indecisiveness 
				can keep you from perparing, which leads to bad performance - vicious cycle 
		metanalytic study - study in a specific field - using this we found negative correlation anxiety and gpa 
		causes and treatments 
			Lack of preparation - people who dont prepare well tend to be more anxious 
				solution: better preparation - know more about your exam e.g. test format, time alloted, syllabus, grading - setting up a study schedule (be realistic, if you cant achieve your goal it will further increase your anxiety), which will help you manage time and have clarity of the goal you want to achieve - testing yourself on material 
			study on testing effect - experimental group 1 given article on psych study - then theyre given a mock test to do - 3 days later they took final test 
				experimental group 2 only given article and then restudying session (statements about article they read recently) which were the same as the questions in the trial test (to equate information exposure) - then they took final test 3 days later
				control group just read the article and took the final test  
					experimental group 1 performed better in the final test 
					then experimental group 2 
					then control group 
				justifying the results - experimental group 1 got feedback on their trial test - and helps them identify their weak points 
					what if feedback on trial test wasnt given? 
				modified study - no feedback on trial test - people in trial test group still performed the best 
				what happens when we take the trial test - effortful retrieval - when we do the test we are actively retrieving the material - this is strengthened and its easier for you during the final test - multiple retrieval "roots" formed which makes it easier to find relevant information in memory 
			Irrational beliefs - have to understand consequences of our beliefs 
				activating event -> activates belief -> determines consequences 
				negative and irrational beliefs -> negative and irrational consequences 
				e.g. "will do all right on test" thought less likely in people with high test anxiety 
				solution: identify irrational beliefs - become aware of these, as they can be subconscious or involuntary 
					  make rational beliefs that counteract these beliefs 
					e.g. "People who leave earlier know everything already. im a dumbass" - but "leaving early does not confirm that they good. it may also mean that they left some questions" "therefore I should take my time to finish"
				once you can think in more positive way your anxiety will go down 
			High stress reactivity - react to stressor much stronger - this is cause of genes - they control level of stress hormones produced upon stressor 
				relaxation skills can reduce stress anxiety 
			summary: find the underlying anxiety and treat accordingly

Interpersonal relationships 

stages in intimate relationships 
	Attraction 
		Physical attractiveness 
			men place more importance on this 
				questionnaire - shows men mainly look for physical attractiveness and youth 
					whereas women look for men who are ambitious, have good status, earning potential and fondness for children 
				why is there such a gender difference 
					parental investment theory - 
						humans - top goal is to make species survive
						men - goal is to spread offspring - mate with as many women as possible - has adaptive survival value 
							youth - more fertile, attractive - good genes 
						women - goal is to protect offspring, ensure survival
			good predictor of frequency of dating - the more attractive you are, the more frequently you go on dates 
			experiment 
				752 freshmen, assigned in pairs, danced and talked for 2.5 hrs 
				filled questionnaire about personality, value and physical attractiveness of partner 
					similarity in personality and personal values + higher attractiveness - people more likely to date 
				but physical attractiveness is the major determinant - first impressions matter!!!
			this begins in infancy as well 
				babies held by one ugly and one pretty woman
					babies held by attractive people gaze at those people longer than babies who are held by unattractive people  
	Building 
	Continuation 
	Deterioration 
			for toddlers
				experiment - these children assigned to one of 2 rooms, one with attractive stranger and one with non attractive stranger - 
				measured - how long child looked at person, what kind of interactions did they have with that person 
				for ugly strangers - some of the children started crying 
			but what is physical attractiveness?
				facial dissimilarity - dont wanna date your brother 
				first impressions are decisive - the conversation after makes little difference 
					its the body that counts 
						men - waist to hip ratio - hourglass figure - indicates higher fertility 
						women - want height - most important  
				waist to hip ratio 
					lower - lower levels of testosterone 
					lower - higher fertility - easier to reproduce
					most popular choice across cultures = 0.7
					playboy models also have a similar waist hip ratio 
				facial features
					symmetry 
					need an "average" face - big nose, small eyes -> no game 
						face appears to be more familiar to you - more safe 
			why physical attractiveness
				 - good fertility
				 - associate with positive traits - good personality, sociable, successful, higher status etc. 	
					why? - popular culture - controls our perceptions 
						good guys in movies - pretty 
						bad guys in movies - ugly 
			Attraction also due to proximity 
				study - college students recruited - all lived in student halls - randomly assigned to apartments - asked to list 3 closest friends - researchers wanted to see what factors would breed interpersonal relationship - if people lived 1 door away, 41% chance they are close friends, but if people lived 4 doors away, chances drop to 10%
				rationale - frequency of interaction - higher oppportunities to interact if people are closer physically
				mere exposure effect
					stimulus (person) novel to the rater - if you are exposed to stimulus more often, more likely to have positive rating 
						only exposure, no interaction required
					study - participants assigned to 2 groups - high frequency exposure group and low frequency exposure group
						high freq exposure - target stimulus shown multiple times							e.g. of stimuli - computer generated men's faces, novel to the participants, made up chinese characters, turkish words  
							more favourable to faces exposed to  
						low freq exposure - target stimulus shown 1-2 times	
					rationale - more familiarity with the stimuli - humans evolved to have more favourable attitude to more familiar stimuli - you feel safe? 
					what happens if initial reaction is negative - does negativity amplify - yes it does - cause your initial feelings are consolidated - need other strategies 
					mere exposure works iff initial impressions are positive or neutral 
			Similarity vs complementarity 
				debate - what breeds attraction? Similarity or complementarity 
					similarity - personality, attitudes and values same => attraction
					complementarity - opposites attract - attracted to people strikingly different from us 
					depends on the relationship 
						casual - opposites attract - studies show this - as people want something more exciting - explore the other side 
						comitted - similars attract - as people want to live with something more familiar - if people similar their relationship lasts longer  
				studies also find that we tend to become friends with similar people 
					roommates asked to fill questionnaire about personality traits 
					then followed for 6 mos 
					seen that if roommates have similar traits then theyre more likely to become friends 
				rationale
					self-esteem boost - when people agree with your opinion, you feel good about yourself 
					people generally like themselves - if someone similar to you, then theyre more likely to like you too 
			Reciprocity 
				if you discover that someone likes you, you might discover feelings for them 
					"if you like me, you must have excellent judgement"
					self-fulfilling prophecy - 
						study - participants randomly matched in pairs, one male and one female. Given 5 mins to get to know each other - then separated into different rooms, one received positive feedback that partner liked them and other received negative feedback - then each pair asked to discuss current affairs. Independent rater rates each pair's interaction. If a person was led to believe that partner liked them, they were more positive - interrupted less often, agreed more often, smiled more often. After the interaction, people asked to rate their partner. The people who were paired with people who were led to believe that their partner liked them rated their partners higher 
						if you know someone likes you, you would have more positive expectations from that person, which will change your behaviour. this will make the other person have more expectations, which will change their behaviour as well 
						applicable for other situations too - e.g. job interviews, attitude towards course - if you expect to fail the course, you will lower your initial expectations, and then involuntarily work towards that, and fulfil these expectations
						strong effects on people with low self-esteem and with need for social approval 
							study - females asked to fulfil questionnaire about personality, divided into 2 groups - one given positive feedback on personality and one given negative feedback - for each group a male confedereate starts conversations and asks them out - found out that people in group that was given negative feedback were more likely to go out with the dude - cause the guy gave them approval 
							explains why people fall in love more easily after a break up 
			Liking by association 
				tend to like people with whom we associate positive events, 
				study - male participants assigned to 2 groups. experimenter approached each participant and acted positively to those in first group and then negatively to those in 2nd group. Then participants shown 2 photos, one looked like the experimenter. They had to pick 1. For first group, they picked person A, as they had positive encounter with experimenter. That was not the case for 2nd group, they picked person B, as person A reminds them of the experimenter, whom they dislike 
				applicable for initiation and maintainance of relationship - thats why you should never stop associating your partner with good events - dinners, vacations etc. - you will tend to have more positive feelings towards that person 
			ANY OF THESE FACTORS CAN BE GROUP PROJECT TOPIC 

	STAGES OF ATTRACTION 
		Building 
			Surface contact 
				explore similarity - whether theres anything common between you two. seek common ground 
			Self-disclosure 
				reveal something personal about yourself - goals, values, feelings, something intimate 
				study - people dont self-disclose, which is why friendships dont evolve 
				study - after you disclose, you like them more - as this person is no longer just an acquaintance to you - knows you from the inside 
				study - reciprocity effect -  partner more likely to disclose if you do. 
				study - timing of disclosure important - dont do it too early, as partner may think you may be immature, not serious or lying - need to disclose gradually 
			Mutuality 
				Think of yourselves as a team - sense of "we"
				Intimate feelings tend to grow 
		How does interaction happen? 
			6 styles of love
				friendship - emphasize communication 
				romantic
				possessive - want to know what partner does at all times
				selfless - love=sacrifice, put partner first 
				logical - rational, no "love at first sight" bs, take into account factors before beginning a relationship - e.g. money etc.
				ludus - Not serious, dont want commitment 
	
Love triangle 
	passion
	commitment 
	intimacy 

ideal - consumate love - has all 3 components 
real  - passion difficult to sustain over time 
	Liking - friendships fall into this category
	Infatuation - only passion is present. love at first sight. Dont know much about that person 
	Empty love - commitment only, no passion and intimacy - stagnant relationships, passion adn intimacy fades away over time - married couples stay together for the kids - arranged marriage 
	Romantic love - passion and intimacy but no commitment - common with young people 
	Companionate love - partner close friend - passion has faded 
	Fatuous love - passion and commitment - no time for intimacy for develop 
	Consummate love - all 3 components 

	compatibility 
		difference in levels of each of the factors between the partners determines satsfaction with the relationship - smaller the difference then both are satisfied - if difference large then the relationship may dissolve 
	
	why does passion fade?
		idealized views about love - but reality over time is quite different - as reality sets in passion decreases 
		Novelty of new partner causes uncertainties - and this creates excitement - but over time novelty decreases as routine settles in 
		Passion is a product of arousal - if with a person for the first time, you are physiologically aroused - but people cannot stay in that state forever
		Lesson - do new things on a regular basis 


	determinants of relationship satisfaction 
		Humor - more humor, more satisfaction 
			rationale - Liking by association principle 
			important in times of conflict - humor helps ease tension and anger piling up 
		Selective attention - Happy couples selectively see their partners' positive attributes 
			when asked to recall events, happy couples recalled positive events, unhappy couples recalled negative events 
			study - both unhappy and happy couples invited, each person given 5 photos of partner modified - 2 were attractive, 3 were unattractive - have to pick photo that best represents their partner - happy couples tend to pick the idealized version, unhappy couples picked the unattractive photo 
	
		positivity - acting in a positive manner towards a partner 
			negative escalation loop - partners retaliate to negativity by negativity, creating an endless cycle 
			how do happy couples deal with negative comments - editing - call for time out, calm down and then discuss the issue 
		Openness - self-disclosure - share true feelings and thoughts about partner and relatipnship - without fear of loosing 
			this usually does not happen 
			Good with good listeners - growth promoting listeners 
							maintain eye contact 	
							lean towards the partner 
							seldom interrupt 
		Intimacy - physical and emotional 
		Assurance - show partner commitment and that relationship has a future 
			- promote commitment 
			- through verbal and actions
		Social network - have strong network of friends and family - include them in activities - larger common social network indicates more similarity between partners - also cost to end relationship goes up 
		Tasks sharing 
			e.g. doing the dishes 
			Perceived fairness of tasks is more important than actual fairness 
		Equity - what you give is what you get from the relationship 
			predictor of relationship satisfaction 
			if partner has equal assets, you will be more satisfied 
			sometimes couples mismatched - man old but lady young - but man has money - mismatch in attractiveness compensated with finacial resources 
	
	Conflict management 
		Inevitable in a relationship 
		Some can affect quality of a relationship 
		Risk markers - more frequent these are the more likely the relationship is to end 
			Withdraw - avoid talking about the problem and just walk away = avoidant coping. The other partner would attack, chasing the other to talk about the issue 
				Men more likely to withdraw 
			Escalation - anger piles up, unresolved old issues resurface - you should focus on the current issue 
			Invalidation - attacking others - blame game 
			Negative interpretation - attribute problem to each other's personality traits - instead you should look for situational factors, something that is beyond your control, then youre more likely to be considerate 

	Couples by conflict management styles 
		Validating couples - listen and mutual respect - ideal 
		Volatile couples - always argue with each other, but still love each other and overall more positive interactions occur 
		Avoidant couples - Very harmonous, rarely argue - but there are lots of differences between them, but they try to minimize them as they may harm the relationship - avoidant coping used - but there are underlying unresolved issues 
		Hostile couples - Frequent arguments, lack of support and affection		

	deterioration and dissolution 
		why do couples want to end their relationship?
			- lack of rewards - the positive things from a relationship e.g. social support, practical resources like money 
			- cost goes up - resources devoted to a relationship goes up e.g. time given to partner, compromise on existing friend circle 
			- outcome - balance between cost and outcome - compared with ideal ratio (ideal balance between cost and benefit, comes from observation, experiences, fiction) - if reality falls short of ideal, then satisfaction level tends to be low 
				but this is not necessary to determine end of relationship - people take into consideration 2 more factors 
			- investments - resources put in relationship - sunken costs - cannot be given back if relationship ended - e.g. time and youth, common friends and affiliations - 
				couples with stronger common social networks - less likely to end their relationship
			- comparison level of alternative options - what kind of rewards, costs in other possible relationships, if no better option exists then wont end the relationship	
		comparison - satisfaction from alternative options + investment = commitment 
		common reasons for breaking up 
			in slides 
		homogamy or similarity important - if more difference then higher possibility of breakup 
		why do married couples end their relationship?
			differences as well, abuse, poor communication, not meeting family obligations, infidelity 

HEALTH BEHAVIOURS 
	7 good habits discussed 

	health belief model 	
		likelihood of getting into good behaviour depends on the following 
			perceived health threat 
			perceived threat reduction 
			e.g. likelihood of quitting smoking 
				perceived susceptibility - are u vulnerable to developing health problem - subjective feeling - do you THINK youlll get cancer 
				perceived severity - evaluate how serious the possible health problem is - e.g. lung cancer leads to death - therefore severity is higher - 
					the higher susceptibilty and severity - higher health threat - therefore you are more likely to engage in recommended behaviour 
				
				preceived benefits - positive outcomes from engaging in recommended behavour - e.g. if you stop smoking you feel more energetic 
				perceived barriers - e.g. peer pressure - most of your friends smoke - can you resist? stress - e.g. smoking can help relax. are u unable to cope with stress? 
					these 2 lead to perceived threat reduction 
				self efficacy - are u capable of performing the behaviour - do you think you can quit smoking - can you resist the temptation 

	theory of planned behaviour 
		behaviour intent - will you do the behaviour 
		depends on 
			behavioural outcome - how does qutting smoking help? estimation of the outcome e.g. health improves 
			outcome evaluation - is the reduction of risk of lung cancer is desirable? are u concerned with your health? if not, your evaluation of this outcome would be neutral
				this makes up your attitude towards behaviour 
			Normative beliefs - what you think other people want you to do - do they want you to stop smoking? 
			motivation to comply 
				this adds up to subjective norms 
			preceived behavioural control - can you stop smoking? can you control yourself, despite peer pressure? this has direct effect on behaviour intent and the output behaviour 
	
	substance abuse and dependence 
		theyre different things
		abuse - use is associated with negative or dangerous outcomes, but despite that you continue to use - stressors include poor performance in school, recurrent legal problems 
		dependence - person has become dependent on substance, physically or psychologically. symptoms:
			sense of loss of control - you use more than you thought you would or intended to. any efforts to control are useless 
			psychological craving - strong desire to use substance - 
			tolerance - it goes up - higher and higher amount of substance required to achieve the same effect - biological justifications - e.g. liver develops tolerance to alcohol 
			withdrawl syndroms - unpleasent physiological effects associated with not taking a substance after they have become dependent - e.g. anxiety, delirium tremens (e.g. hallucinations, disorientation, heart attack and stroke)
		
	alcohol
		is a depressant - drug that decreases rates of activity of central nervous system
		initially people feel calm, stimulatory effect, reduced anxiety 
		but high dosage - leads to depression of function of brain, impaired motor control, depression 
		binge drinking - drinking a lot - >= 5 drinks in a single occassion - saturday is the risk period 
		why do males drink more than females? turn in next class
			- social pressure - males expected to drink more - to appear more masculine - gender role expectations - 

		leads to impairment of interpersonal relationships (often get into fights) and cognitive functioning - this happens over time 
			shrinkage in brain tissues - frontal lobe (higher intellectual functions - e.g. decision making)
						   - hippocampus - responsible for memory - you therefore tend to be forgetful
			traffic accidents - 40% of traffic deaths are linked to alcohol -
			6 cans of beer - 25x more likely to die 
			alcohol during preagnency - fetal alcohol syndrome - children born with abnormal facial features 
									- growth retardation 
										tend to be of a smaller size 
									- permanent Central nervous system damage - poor memory, ADD, poor reasoning, impulsive, mental retardation - very difficult to discipline these children 
			genetic factors - alcohol abuse is due to this 
				dont know exact gene 
				twin studies - 2 types of twins - one that share 100% genetic makeup, the other share only 50% of genetic makeup 
					concordance rate - rate at which both abuse alcohol
					this is higher among 1st group than in 2nd group - as 1st group twins are more similar - similar genetic makeup 	
			nurture factors - alcohol abuse caused by environmental factors - e.g. how you are raised 
				stress - tends to trigger the onset of alcohol abuse - esp. for those without stress management skills - alcohol is avoidant coping strategy
				substance use is reinforced - alcohol consumption is followed by positive consequences - e.g. pleasurable outcomes (e.g. dont have to think about problems in your life) and peer acceptance ()
			depression - these guys tend to be sad all the time - lack the motivation to do anything - sometimes they may not seek help - use alcohol to treat their depression symptoms 
				males more likely to do this - gender roles - men are expected to solve problems on their own - seeking help is a sign of weakness 
				here we have to treat both disorders simultaneously 
			parenting style - way the parents discipline their children 
				Degree of love - 
				degree of control - do they closely monitor their parent's behaviours 
				we can classify into 4 parents 
					authoritative parents - high love, high control 
					permissive parents - high love, low control 
						spoil their kids - children therefore tend to be impulsive 
					neglecting parents - low love, low control 
						the invisible parents - more likely to develop alcohol abuse 
					authoritative parents - ?? 
					alcohol depndence - mainly depends on level of control  
			All we can do is control their environment - 
		Eating disorders 
			mortality rate for eating disorders is the highest 
			onset in 13-19 year olds 
			mostly females (some homo males, bi males, athletes, percentage rate is much lower)
			Anorexia Nervosa 
				refusal to maintain BMI for age
				fear of gaining weight
				self eval is influenced by body shape and weight - self competence solely based on this criteria 
					slight increase in weight -> self esteem totalled 
					denial of seriousness of current body weight - deny that theyre suffering from disorder - problem for therapists as patients are not willing to seek treatment - basically dont follow recommendations by therapists - compliance rate is therefore very low 
						they need to be told that they have a problem 
				amenorrhea - for females only - absence of menstruation for 3 consecutive cycles - a symptom 
				two types 
					Restrictive subtypes - fasting or excessive exercise -  to maintain weight 
					Purging subtype - vomit or laxative to get rid of food 
				co-occurs usually with anxiety and depression 
				there are physical signs too 
					tiny hair develop all over the body - similar to that in premature babies - developed in order to stay warm 
				always underweight 
			Bulimia Nervosa 
				recurrent episodes of binge eating - due to loss of control - then use purging or restriction  to compensate 
				fluctuate between these two 
				self-eval - influenced by body shape and weight 
				these guys may be overweight 
				consequences - depend on compensatory behaviour
					erosion of dental enamel = due to self-induced vomiting - look for collisus on patients' fingers 
					colon damage - kidney failure - due to laxatives 
					irregular heart rate 
					can lead to death 
			why would you develop eating disorders?
				gender specific - over 90% of cases occur in females
				culture specific - more common in developed countries - much lower in developing countries 
						caused by expectations in ideal body figure - expect females to be thin, if you violate this you will be considered as physically unattractive
							higher the discrepancy between culture ideal and your own image - higher the dissatisfaction 
							drive much higher amongst females  
						developing countries - chubby women considered more wealthy - Excuse me wtf 
				studies
					male ideal > male attractive > female attractive 
					female ideal < female attractive < female attractive < female current 
						serious discrepancy compared to male counterparts 
				more exposure to mass media - more likely to develop these disorders - as models there are slimmer, have hourglass shape etc. 
				weight control - lifelong process - applies to all ages 
				slimness - equated with having a happy relationship 
				causes
					peer and parental influence 
					major life events + combined with anxiety depression - can be a triggering factor 


SELF IDENTITY 
Who am I
answer to this question is your self concept 
	multi-dim construct 
		physical
			psychological sense of your physical being - discrepancy between objective reality and subjective reality possible 
			strength - are u fatigued? are u active - sports competence 
		social	
			sum of social roles that you play - e.g. student, SU member, son, brother etc 
			role schema - defines how you should act depending on your role - if schema violated then lower score given 
				people will try to act in accordance to role schema 
				plays a vital role in self evaluation 
		emotional 
			subjective sense of emotional being 
				ability to get in touch to your inner emotions - do you understand your own feelings towards events 
				self-regulation - can you control your mood despite triggering event 
				expression - can you express your emotions in an appropriate way - so people would know how you feel - 
			equivalent to emotional intelligence 
				women generally have higher eq 
				men are expected to be stoic - need to surpress (negative) emotions 
		academic 	
			your pereception of your competence in the academic area - its very specific 
				e.g. you may see yourself as strong in math but not in arts 

	what influences these? 
		social comparison theory 
			we compare ourseives to reference group - people close to us 
				upward comparison - compare yourself with people better than you - used for self improvement 
				downward comparison - compare youself to someone whos worse - to make ourselves feel better 
		feedback
			taken more seriously from people that matter more 
			subjective perception of feedback - feedback needs to align with the existing self concept - otherwise it is discarded 
			extra sensory perspective study 
				people asked if they believe in ESP 
					half of participants given studies that show ESP true 
					other half given studies that show otherwise 
				afterwards - people asked to recall elements of studies 
					people who believed in ESP that were shown supporting studies 
					people who didnt believe and were shown equivalent studies 
						they had best performance 
					the other 2 groups dont have good recall - some of them even misremembered research findings - 
						this shows that they distort studies to fit their existing beliefs 
			feedback from others - a study 
				group of confident athletes 
					half given positive feedback gfrom coaches 
					half given negative feedback - these guys misremembered and had bad recall 
		cultural values 
			can encompass lots of things - we focus on 
				individualism 
					tend to define themselves as individuals - define themselves in terms of unique characteristics and goals - not afraid of conflicts 
					individualistic culture - son does what he wants, regardless of parents desires 
				collectivism 
					tend to have an interdependence view of self - define themselves in terms of group membership - e.g. sister of/student in etc - dont want conflicts - want a harmonous relationship with others - willing to sacrifice to pursue group goal
					e.g. china, india 
			study
				college students asked to complete questionnaire 
				receive pen as a gift 
					for students raised in collectivistic cultures - pick yellow pen - the common choice 
					for individualistic ones - pick green pen - unique 
		Identity crisis 
			erikson psychosocial theory - each stage in your life has a crisis 
				your ability to solve every crisis depends on whether u solved previous crises 
				if not then gg 
			marcia theory of deintity achievement 
				no timeline - can happen at any time 
					can be reoccuring - can happen after resolution 
					identity status - degree of crisis and degree of commitment 
						depends on parenting style and personality (inborn and upbringing experience)
						Identity achievement - high crisis high commitment 
							gone through identity crisis in the past 
							able to resolve - committed themselves to clear set of values
							have figured out who you are 
							factors
								parents supportive 
								high performance under pressure
								high self esteem 
						identity foreclosure - low crisis high commitment 
							simply follow expectations of others
							committed to set of beliefs 
							havent gone through self questioning 
							common in collectivistic cultures 
								obedient to authority 
								dependent personality 
								parents overly involved 
						identity moratorium - high crisis low commitment 
							serious self-questioning 
							but havent figured out solution yet 
							common amongst young people 
							factors 	
								parents have inconsistent parenting 
								anxious personality 
						identity diffusion - low crisis low commitment 
							dont have clear sense of who they are - and they dont care 
							poorest psychological well being 
							common in children - which is normal 
							in adults - very unhealthy 
							factors
								parents permissive (no boundaries) or rejecting (not loving)
		self esteem 
			not equivalent to self confidence
			self confidence = your capability 							
			self esteem = overall worth as a person 
			aspect of self 
				actual self = qualities and characteristics you actually possess e.g. homo guy, actual self is homo, maybe hides it from society 
				ideal self = what you would like to become e.g. ideally you would want to reveal your sexuality and have it accepted by society 
				ought self = what you should have or who you should become by standards of society e.g. ought self would be hetrosexual instead of homo 
			discrepancies between all aspects
				if small difference then high self esteem 
				if large difference then low self esteem - because you are not living up to your or other people's expectation 
					e.g. ideally you want to have 3.9 but u actually have 3.5 - you fucked up 
			high self esteem 
				high confidence - 
				take credit for success - attribute to efforts and beliefs, which further reinforces their self esteem 
				eager to take challenges - more self confidence 
			overly inflated self esteem 	
				grandiose representation of self = detatched from objective reality - narsicistic tendencies 
					preoccupied with fantasies of success 
					deserve special treatment 
					respond negatively to negative evaluation - perceive this as threat to integrity 
				differennce in degree of narcissism - difference in negative eval reaction 
					study - students taken for lab exercise, paired, each participant paired with lab guy pretending to be participant 
						asked to write essay, taken for feedback, returned with comments by researchers or participants - this was experimental evaluation 
							half received positive feedback, half received negative "this is one of the worst essays ive ever read"
						next section of study - competitive reaction task - compete with other participants in reaction time - pressing a button - fastest would be winner - and he can punish loser with noise - can control intensity and duration of noise (degree of agressiveness)
						findings
							when people receive negative eval - they put high level of agressiveness on punishment 
							but narcisitc people - tend to administer noise levels with highest level of agressiveness, 
								different for normal people, who reacted relatively less agressively 
						implication - previously, psychs thought agressiveness higher on people with lower self esteem, however, this study shows otherwise - 
									impacts treatment - previously, patients were given self esteem boosts. but now, we need to lower self-esteem - need more accurate,real estimate of self worth 
			low self-esteem 	
				distrust their partners - trouble in romantic relationships 
				poor performance 
					low self esteem leads to negative expectations, which create anxiety, which leads to failure as youre overwhelmed with anxiety, which makes you blame yourslelf - self fulfilling prophecy - you change your behaviour to fulfil your expectations
				emotional problems 
					depends on where discrepancies lie - based on studies 
					actual vs ideal self - not living up to your own standards - dissapointed with self, "no matter what youll not get GS" - depression
					actual vs ought self - anxiety related problems, as you want to hide your true self - so u worry a lot 
				fix 
					change behaviours to bring it in line to ideal self - work out, study harder 
					recognize unrealistic goals - if not then frustration is imminent - cant get 4.3 if u retard - so aim for 3.5 like a jackass  
					learn more about self - studies found that ppl with low self esteem dont know their strengths and weaknesses - need to know more clear self concept - utilize social comparison or feedback - you will find something youre good at 
					modify negative self talks - you convice yourself that you bad, so you give up without trying/when facing difficulties - need to make these more realistic 
			relationships between age, gender and self esteem 
				age 
					children - high self esteem 
					adolescence - self esteem drops - uncertainty about future, puberty (females experience increase in body fat, leading to eating disorders, discrepancy between ideal hourglass shape and actual self) (), discrepancies in degree of autonomy between parents and children - this causes difference between actual and ideal self  
					adulthood - slowly increases - settle down, get a job, find your place in world, less uncertainties - can enjoy outcome of things you have invested in
					mid adulthood - increases to highest level - ^^^
					old age - drops - become burden to society, people retire - may experience financial difficulties - difference between actual and ideal living standard, reduction in physical condition - fallen and cant get up 
				gender
					men overall have higher self esteem than men 
					expectations of how you look - impacts more women than men 
					gender role expectations - women expected to adopt multiple roles - work during day, take care of children at night 
					women have lower education and income level on average - more likely therefore to experience stress e..g financial difficulties - they ideally want to have a better life but limited edu and income doesnt allows this 
		biases in self perception 
			self verification bias - favour feedback that aligns with our expectations 
				your self identity is more stable - without self verification bias you have no self identity 
				cant take constructive feedbacks objectively 
				3 types 
					biased search of info - tend to look for feedback that is consistent with own ideas -
						study: people given questionnaire that measures whether positvie or negative self concept 
						????
						if participant had positive self concept, u tend to look for positive people 
				confirmation bias - different - about general beliefs 
					biased interpretation of info - depending on existing self concept 
						study - people asked to indicate whether they support death penalty or not, all given 2 studies, one that supports death penalty, one that doesnt 
							then they have to rate quality of these 2 studies - how well were they conducted - flaws in research design 
							participants who supported death penalty rated 1 higher, as they think the 2nd one has more flaws, those who didnt rated 2 higher 
						
					biased memory - human memory not reliable 
							study - people assessed on how shy they were at 5 year intervals from age 10 
								group1 - high average shyness 
								group2 - initially shy but became more outgoing 
								asked to recall how they were at age 25 how they were like at age 10 - recall how they interaceted with strangers 
									group1 - has more accurate memory 
									group2 - remember themselves as more outgoing
